                        staircase that serves as the entrance into the labyrinth. As your party continues to circle the
                        stairs, the morning sun begins to grow dimmer and dimmer - it then dawns upon the members of
                        your party that this is likley the last time they will ever see the sun again, and this
                        realization
                        gives them a brief pause. But whatever goals the disparate members of your party possess keep
                        them
                        marching ever forwards, as regardless as to what their goals may be - they will all start and
                        end within the
                        labyrinth.</p>

                <p class="game-text">The world is dying.<br>Bingus, The Mage of Light, once a bulwark against the
                    evils of the world - has betrayed us all. His fortresses, once bastions of good, had been morphed
                    into labyrinths containing portals to the 7 hells. First local towns fell to the
                    legions that spewed out of them. Life itself was exterminated in their wake, replaced with all
                    manners of abhorrent creations from the now fallen mage Bingus. Soon cities fell to the legions of
                    the hells, their inhabitants turned into mutated servants, a sick mockery of their former selves.
                    The empires in which these cities once stood soon too fell one by one, and as the threat posed by
                    this invasion had become glaringly apparent, even once bitter foes began to
                    put aside their differences to stop the rising tide.<br>As it became increasingly clear that Bingus`
                    fortresses were the source of the forces of the hells, expeditions composed of the worlds strongest:
                    mages, warriors, and paladins alike were launched within them to halt the flow once and for all.
                    Some were successful, destroying the bridge between the hells and our world, but most were not, only
                    adding fuel to the ever burning fire.<br>
                    The legions pushed ever forwards, having purged entire continents of life. It is within the last
                    great empire, Nekotaria - once the home of Bingus, that the world makes its last stand. Within its
                    capital's walls lies the seemingly dormant fortress of Mori. Vagrants, legends, criminals, exiles
                    and heroes alike attempt to reach its depths, whether for fame, wealth, or atonement - and your
                    party is no different. But time
                    is running out, and this may be the last chance to save anyone or anything.</p>
